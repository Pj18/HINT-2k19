Hack in the North Project
In today's modern world, digitization is everything. Our challenge was to bring about this digitized change to solve a problem that we all commonly face in restaurants. That's when we came up with 'Foodality', an Augmented Reality based dining experience. Imagine sitting in an unfamiliar restaurant, having no clue what's good and what's not. You look at the waiter for help but his/her description of the food is just not enough. You are not aware of its quantity, the reviews, and its appearance. That's where we come in. Our project lets the users to visually experience the dishes as if it were right in front of them. The experience also includes food customization,  description, and reviews. In this way, our app ensures that the customer is served exactly what he expected.
